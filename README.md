We cannot use classification in this project because the classifier generally separates distinct classes, and so this classifier expects a string or an integer type to distinguish different classes from each other (this is called the "target " Is known). You can read more about this in Introduction to Classifiers.

The problem we are trying to solve is to determine a continuous numerical output, Result. This is known as a regression problem, so we need to use a regression algorithm (such as DecisionTreeRegressor).
